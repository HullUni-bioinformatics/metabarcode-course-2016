## Exercise 2- exploring and handling NGS data ##

In this [notebook](https://github.com/HullUni-bioinformatics/metabarcode-course-2016/blob/master/data/exercise-2/fastq_explore_and_process.ipynb) we will demonstrate some basic routines for exploring, handling, filtering, and processing (read merging, -clustering) of fastq data in the metabarcoding context.

The notebook assumes that you have downloaded the Illumina data as described [here](https://github.com/HullUni-bioinformatics/metabarcode-course-2016/blob/master/data/raw_Illumina_data/Download_Illumina_data_from_SRA.ipynb). Filepaths will need to be amended depending on which location in your filesystem you decide to make your working directory.
