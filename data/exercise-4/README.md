## Exercise 4 - Reference database curation ##

This exercise will focus on the assessment and phylogenetic curation of custom reference databases for metabarcoding applications.

We will be running `SATIVA` a tool for 'Phylogeny-aware identification and correction of taxonomically mislabeled sequences'. All necessary input files are present in the directory `input_data`. Full documentation on how these input data was generated are present in the directory `supplementary_data`.

To run `SATIVA` on the example dataset that we have prepared, please follow the instructions in [this]() notebook.

Find some discussion on the results in the course [manual](://docs.google.com/document/d/1h9d0JrTsDLzsOV5klMkD47807dWTmcXN3uxoYp0ei64/edit#heading=h.47vs6jk5xu41).
