SATIVA v0.9-55-g0cbb090, released on 2016-06-28. Last version: https://github.com/amkozlov/sativa 
By A.Kozlov and J.Zhang, the Exelixis Lab. Based on RAxML 8.2.3 by A.Stamatakis.

SATIVA was called as follows:

./sativa/sativa.py -s alignment.phy -t tax_for_SATIVA.tax -x zoo -n CytB -o ./ -T 5 -v

Mislabels search is running with the following parameters:
 Alignment:                        alignment.phy
 Taxonomy:                         tax_for_SATIVA.tax
 Output directory:                 /home/working/media/chrishah/STORAGE/metabarcoding/PHYLOGENETIC_PLACEMENT/Lake_fish/CytB/Reference_DB/3-SATIVA
 Job name / output files prefix:   CytB
 Model of rate heterogeneity:      AUTO
 Confidence cut-off:               0.000000
 Number of threads:                5
